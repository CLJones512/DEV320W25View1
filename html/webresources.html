        <span class="strong"><h2>W3Schools</h2><br></span>
        I found this all the way back in my first web design class. It has tutorials for so many different web based
        languages, and I use it quite a bit to this day. Regardless of whether I need to quickly review a basic concept 
        or learn something completely new, it's always in my back pocket to pull out whenever I need it. As a bonus, it
        has a nice little editor embedded in all the exercises so I can quickly test something before I try it on my own
        applications.<br><br>

        Another all purpose reference, this time for all things programming, web based or otherwise. This one is another
        great one to keep in your back pocket, although it does have a couple of drawbacks. First off, it's not entirely
        free the way W3Schools is, so some content is behind a paywall. Also, I found the site a little bit more difficult
        to navigate, and more often than not I find myself navigating there from Google instead of the site itself. All in all
        though, it's still a great resource.<br><br>

        <span class="strong"><h2>Stack Overflow</h2><br></span>
        Ah yes, Stack Overflow. We've all ended up here far more than any of us are willing to admit. To me, this almost feels like
        a bit of a last resort. Will you get the solution you need? Probably. Will you get a needlessly complicated solution written
        by someone who's mercilessly judging the original poster? Most definitely. Not the first place I'd go when I need help with
        something, but more times than not it'll help dig me up.<br><br>

        <span class="strong"><h2>LinkedIn Learning</h2><br></span>
        This one isn't so much of a resource to go to when I'm in the thick of my work, but rather one to go to when I'm trying to gather
        information. The videos are very comprehensive, and they teach me all I need to know about various aspects of application development
        plus so much more. Sometimes the videos can drone on long after I've gotten the point, and it's definitely not a resource to reference
        on the fly, but it's still good for information gathering.<br><br>

        This is one that I found very recently. Like LinkedIn learning, this isn't so much of a quick reference type of site, but rather one for
        spending a while working through the tutorials, as they have a lot of free workshops on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more. I haven't spent
        a ton of time yet looking through the site, but they have a very wide range of different classes that I can take in my spare time to help
        make me a better web developer.<br><br>
